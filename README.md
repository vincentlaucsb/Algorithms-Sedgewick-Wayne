# Algorithms
This is my personal collection of notes, exercise solutions, and code I've made while reading Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
Most of the code is in Java, although some are translated into Python and C++.

## A Note on Correctness
While I do my best to avoid errors, some of these exercises are pretty challenging and sometimes I get lazy so take my answers with a grain of salt.
